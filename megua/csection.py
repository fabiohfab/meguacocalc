class SectionClassifier:
    """
    An exercise could contain um its %summary tag line a description of section
    in form::

       %sumary section descriptive text; subsection descriptive text; etc

    The class transform contents of some MegUA database into a tree of sections specifying exercises as leaves.
    Then, this tree can be flushed out to some file or output system.

    STRUTURE SAMPLE::

        contents -> { 'Section1': Section('Section1',0), 'Section2': Section('Section2',0) }
        For each Section object see below in this file.
        A brief description is:
            * a SectionClassifier is the "book" made with keys (chapter names) that are keys of a dictionary.
            * SectionClassifier is a dictionary: keys are the chapter names and the values are Section objects.
            * a Section object is defined by 
                * a name (the key of the SectionClassifiers appears again in sec_name)
                * level (0 if it is top level sections: chapters, and so on)
                *  a list of exercises beloging to the section and
                * a dictionary of subsections (again Section objects)
            * Section = (sec_name, level, [list of exercises names], dict( subsections ) )

    EXAMPLES::

    .. test with: sage -python -m doctest csection.py 

    Create or edit a database::

       >>> from all import *
       >>> meg = MegBook(r'./.testoutput/csection.sqlite')
       MegBook opened. Execute `MegBook?` for examples of usage.
       Templates for 'pt_pt' language.
